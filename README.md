# Why YouZeroed?
With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), mathematics has also evolved. Many people are excited to learn AI, but it’s important to realize that AI is based on math. AI is now used in almost every part of life, making math more important than ever. It has even been called the "learning of the future."

To succeed in machine learning, people need to understand calculus, statistics, algebra, and probability. However, math is often seen as difficult because students struggle to connect concepts to real-world uses. This problem comes from how math is taught. In schools, math is often treated as just another subject to pass exams, instead of as a tool for problem-solving and logic.

When students don’t learn to make sense of numbers early, they find math harder. They miss the practical side of the subject. Many see math as tough instead of recognizing its role in building reasoning and thinking skills. This is why math should not be taught in just one way. Everyone learns differently.

A personalized math system that focuses on real-life applications can help people see math as part of their daily lives. This approach can reduce the pressure of learning math just to pass an exam.

For progress in any field, great mathematicians are needed in every domain.
